# GermEval 2022
Repository containing the experiments described in our paper for the 
[GermEval 2022 challenge](https://aclanthology.org/2022.germeval-1.1/): 
"Automatic Readability Assessment of German Sentences with Transformer Ensembles" 
([available online](https://aclanthology.org/2022.germeval-1.10/)).

## Dataset 
We translated the given German dataset to English during preprocessing.
The resulting training, validation and test split is available in the folder [data](./data).

Additionally we created some handcrafted readability features for German as well as English.
The scripts used to generate these can be found in [data_processing](./data_processing).
Their corresponding splits can be found in [data/features](./data/features).

## Experiments 
To evaluate the ability of a model (ensemble) to predict the complexity of a sentence, we conducted experiments with the following parameters:

- `BOOTSTRAP_SIZE`: number of random samples with replacement from a given population of models
- `MAX_ENSEMBLE_SIZE`: max amount of members within one ensemble, used to iterate to
- `ENSEMBLE_POOL_SIZE`: model population size

The following experiments are available in [experiments](./experiments):

- `ensemble_size_gbert.py`: evaluating GBERT ensembles
- `ensemble_size_wechsel.py`: evaluating GPT-2-Wechsel ensembles
- `ensemble_size_wechsel_gbert.py`: evalualting mixed ensembles

The submitted best ensemble generation can be found in [submissions/sub_ensemble_wechsel_gbert.py](./submissions/sub_ensemble_wechsel_gbert.py)

## Installation

A current Anaconda/Miniconda environment is required.

To install the given conda environment use the following command:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
